Let's say your app needs to authenticate a user so it'll need the database to re-start, set everything up and then eventually shut down. If this happens for a lot of users for a lot of databases on the same server, the server will get overwhelmed with the requests and just crash. Risk Level: Medium Benchmark: CIS v1.0.0-08-11-2017:2.16, FedRAMP Description: The AUTO_CLOSE option specifies whether the database shuts down cleanly and frees resources after the last user exits. This rule checks that this option is disabled on all databases. Impact: Databases marked with AUTO_CLOSE allows the DB to be closed if there are no active connections. In the case of particularly contained databases, the authentication of users occurs within teh database itself, so the database must be opened every time to authenticate a user. Frequent opening/closing of the database consumes additional resources and may contribute to denial of service attack. How to check if you db is affected: In SSMS, Right click Database->Properties Options page and then under Automatic, if Auto Close is 'True', then it's enabled. Bulk query to find all problem databases: SELECT CASE WHEN EXISTS ( SELECT * FROM sys . databases WHERE NAME = DB_NAME () AND is_auto_close_on = 1 ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS VIOLATION , DB_name () AS [ DATABASE ] ) Remediation Steps/Script: Change Auto Close in Options to 'False' Remediation Script: ALTER DATABASE [ yourDatabaseName ] SET AUTO_CLOSE OFF VA1219 \u00b6 Name: VA1219: Transparent data encryption should be enabled Summary and \"why care\" for dummies: If TDE isn't being done, any backups, etc are encrypted when stored on the computer. So if a malicious person gets access to your computer, they won't be able to decrypt the backups/logs, etc without a key. Risk Level: Medium Description: Transparent data encryption (TDE) helps protect against the threat of malicious activity by performing real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files \u2018at rest\u2019, without requiring changes to the application. This rule checks that TDE is enabled on the database. Impact: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) protects data \u2018at rest\u2019, meaning the data and log files are encrypted when stored on disk. Bulk query to find all problem databases: SELECT CASE WHEN EXISTS ( SELECT * FROM sys . databases WHERE name = db_name () AND is_encrypted = 0 ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS [ Violation ] Remediation Steps/Script: Unmanaged SQL servers: Enable TDE on the affected database. Please follow the instructions on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption Azure SQL VM: Security section is disabled. So....I don't know Azure Managed Database: Login to Portal Search for 'Azure SQL' or 'SQL databases' or whatever Azure calls it that day Choose the interested database On left, click on Security Click on 'Transparent data encryption' Set Data encryption to ON Click on Save VA1287 \u00b6 Name: VA1287: Sensitive data columns should be classified Summary and \"why care\" for dummies: Some columns might have sensitive data that you want to run reports on later. Therefore, if they have metadata that flags these columns, it's easier to run these reports in case you care. Risk Level: Description: This rule discovers and characterizes potentially sensitive data in the database. The result is a collection of sensitive database columns, which should be reviewed and classified using SQL Data Discovery & Classification. This allows database columns to be persistently labeled according to their sensitivity, which enables tracking (auditing) the use of classified data and creating reports. If your sensitive database columns are unprotected, you should also consider applying one of SQL Database\u2019s built-in security capabilities to restrict access to and protect your sensitive data. Impact: The data residing in your database can have varying levels of business and privacy sensitivity. It is important to be aware of the location of your most sensitive data elements, so that their access can be monitored and tracked. SQL Data Discovery & Classification enables you to assign a distinct classification label to each database column and persist this information as column metadata within the database. This classification metadata can then be used for tracking and monitoring objectives. In addition, access to sensitive data should be more tightly controlled. Built-in SQL security capabilities like Always Encrypted, Dynamic Data Masking, and Row-Level Security can be used to control access and protect data. How to check if you db is affected: Run the VA. If your columns have emails, dates, etc, it'll probably get flagged Find all problem databases: Review the identified list of potentially sensitive columns and apply classifications where relevant via the Classify Data task of the database. If none of the identified columns actually represent sensitive elements in your database, you can set them as your approved baseline to acknowledge their status and to prevent them from being identified again. In addition, apply column-level data protection security measures where appropriate: Always Encrypted \u2014 keeps sensitive data columns encrypted on the server side (\u2018 https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=862688&#8217 ;) or Dynamic Data Masking \u2014 limits sensitive data exposure by dynamically masking it to non-privileged users when data is returned from the server to the client (\u2018 https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=524331&#8217 ;). You can also use Row Level Security to restrict access to data rows by creating a security policy based on characteristics of the user executing a query (\u2018 https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=862687\u2019 ). Remediation Steps/Script: Run VA on your specific database to get remediation script but review each one!

Let's say your app needs to authenticate a user so it'll need the database to re-start, set everything up and then eventually shut down. If this happens for a lot of users for a lot of databases on the same server, the server will get overwhelmed with the requests and just crash. Risk Level: Medium Benchmark: CIS v1.0.0-08-11-2017:2.16, FedRAMP Description: The AUTO_CLOSE option specifies whether the database shuts down cleanly and frees resources after the last user exits. This rule checks that this option is disabled on all databases. Impact: Databases marked with AUTO_CLOSE allows the DB to be closed if there are no active connections. In the case of particularly contained databases, the authentication of users occurs within teh database itself, so the database must be opened every time to authenticate a user. Frequent opening/closing of the database consumes additional resources and may contribute to denial of service attack. How to check if you db is affected: In SSMS, Right click Database->Properties Options page and then under Automatic, if Auto Close is 'True', then it's enabled.

Therefore, if they have metadata that flags these columns, it's easier to run these reports in case you care. Risk Level: Description: This rule discovers and characterizes potentially sensitive data in the database. The result is a collection of sensitive database columns, which should be reviewed and classified using SQL Data Discovery & Classification. This allows database columns to be persistently labeled according to their sensitivity, which enables tracking (auditing) the use of classified data and creating reports. If your sensitive database columns are unprotected, you should also consider applying one of SQL Database\u2019s built-in security capabilities to restrict access to and protect your sensitive data. Impact: The data residing in your database can have varying levels of business and privacy sensitivity. It is important to be aware of the location of your most sensitive data elements, so that their access can be monitored and tracked. SQL Data Discovery & Classification enables you to assign a distinct classification label to each database column and persist this information as column metadata within the database. This classification metadata can then be used for tracking and monitoring objectives. In addition, access to sensitive data should be more tightly controlled. Built-in SQL security capabilities like Always Encrypted, Dynamic Data Masking, and Row-Level Security can be used to control access and protect data. How to check if you db is affected: Run the VA. If your columns have emails, dates, etc, it'll probably get flagged Find all problem databases: Review the identified list of potentially sensitive columns and apply classifications where relevant via the Classify Data task of the database. If none of the identified columns actually represent sensitive elements in your database, you can set them as your approved baseline to acknowledge their status and to prevent them from being identified again. In addition, apply column-level data protection security measures where appropriate: Always Encrypted \u2014 keeps sensitive data columns encrypted on the server side (\u2018 https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=862688&#8217 ;) or Dynamic Data Masking \u2014 limits sensitive data exposure by dynamically masking it to non-privileged users when data is returned from the server to the client (\u2018 https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=524331&#8217 ;). You can also use Row Level Security to restrict access to data rows by creating a security policy based on characteristics of the user executing a query (\u2018 https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=862687\u2019 ).
